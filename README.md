THE ODIN PROJECT: DOM MANIPULATION

### Rock Paper Scissors UI ([View in Browser](https://christian-ortega.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-ui/))

This is a browser implementation of the classic hand game "Rock Paper Scissors" with basic UI elements in JavaScript.

This project builds off of my previous implementation of Rock Paper Scissors with no UI elements, where game info was communicated through alert messages and console logs. In this implementation, I added HTML elements along with CSS styling to communicate the game information. I refactored the previous script and replaced any relevant code sections with query selectors. This allowed the page to be dynamic and respond to user input. Thus, the entirety of the game can now be played with a mouse, without relying on user's knowledge of how to operate alert messages or console logs.
