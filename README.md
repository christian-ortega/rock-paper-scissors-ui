THE ODIN PROJECT: ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

Rock Paper Scissors

This is an implementation of the classic hand game "Rock Paper Scissors" using prompts, alerts, and console logs in JavaScript.

In this project, I emphasized the usage of functions, if/else blocks, switch blocks, and for loops. My goal was to make my code as readable as possible, by using such things as helper functions, prototype functions, the ternary conditional operator, and objects. I also wanted to communicate a proper amount of information to the user of this game (current round, user's choice, computer's choice, score, etc.), to make the game accessible for users of different backgrounds.
